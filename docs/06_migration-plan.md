# Migration Plan: HTML Prototype → Next.js + Contentful

## Project Overview

**Main Goal:** Migrate from the current static HTML prototype to a **Next.js-based statically generated website** with **Contentful headless CMS** for #sharp digital transformation consultancy.

**Target Architecture:**
- **Framework**: Next.js (static site generation)
- **CMS**: Contentful (headless) for content management
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Shadcn/UI components
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages

**Business Purpose:**
- Professional website for #sharp digital transformation consultancy
- Showcase 3 service areas: Customer Experience, Operational Efficiency, Data & Analytics
