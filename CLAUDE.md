# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the website for #sharp (https://sharpdigital.co.uk/), a digital agency specialized in digital transformation consultancy. The project is migrating from a static HTML site to a Next.js-based statically generated website with Contentful headless CMS.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (static generation)
- **CMS**: Contentful (headless)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Shadcn/UI components
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions â†’ GitHub Pages

## Development Commands

Currently no build process exists. Future Next.js implementation will need:
- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Static site generation
- `npm run start` - Production preview

## Design System Requirements

### Typography
- **Headings/Titles**: Frutiger45Light (sans-serif) from `/font/` directory
